Cyberpunk Cybernetics adds cybernetics inspired by the world of Cyberpunk and Cyberpunk 2077 to be added to your pawns!
This mod is very work in progress but I intend to expand upon just the basic cybernetics including backstories and custom visuals for the cybernetcis.

Currently there are 4 arm cybernetics:

Gorilla Arms - Outfitted with a kinetic energy recovery system, Gorilla Arms make a reliable replacement for natural limbs, improving both strength and endurance with an overdrive attack that stuns the enemy.
Mantis Blades - The Mantis Blade is implanted in the forearm, and is hidden when not extended. In its extended state, the shape of the Mantis Blade resembles that of the forelegs of the mantis. Given enough room, the user can leap towards a target dealing a large amount of damage.
Projectile Launch System - Installed in the forearm close to the wrist, the Projectile Launch System releases a barrage of micro projectiles with target tracking.
Monowire - The Monowire is a wire that retracts into the wrist, charging to deal a large amount of damage to the target within a decent range.

Dependencies:
- harmony
- jecstools

As far as I'm aware this mod isn't incompatiable with anything however I haven't done extensive testing as this mod is very work in progress, please let me know if you find any bugs or incompatibilities.

Big thanks to jecrell, brrainz and other members of the rimworld discord server!
